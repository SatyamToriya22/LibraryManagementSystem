# LibraryManagementSystem
A Simple Library Management Class made in Python By Satyam Toriya
# What I Do in This Code ?
Firstly I Created Class of Library Which Contains Constructor and Instance Variabels Then I Created Methods for Basically Four Functionality 
1.Display Books
2.Lend Book
3.Add Book
4.Return Book
After This I created a Main function which can create a Class object and Instantiating class.
